<div style="font-size: 14pt; margin-bottom: 10pt">
The IMOL community is organized at two levels: the IMOL Board and the IMOL Members. 
</div>

<h3 style='margin-bottom: 20pt;'>IMOL Board</h3>
<div style="font-size: 14pt; margin-bottom: 10pt">
The IMOL Board is the steering and management body of the IMOL community. In particular, the Board carries out these activities:

<ul style="margin-top: 10pt">
<li>Plans the strategies to develop the IMOL Community and for its overall activities</li>
<li>Selects and directs the main activities of the IMOL Community, such as workshops, special issues, outreach and so forth</li>
<li>Evaluates and approves the applications of candidate IMOL Members</li>
<li>Evaluates and approves the new activities proposed by the IMOL Members, and delegates specific Members for their organisation and implementation</li>
<li>Represents the IMOL community in relations with other communities and associations</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3 style='margin-bottom: 20pt;'>IMOL Members</h3>
<div style="font-size: 14pt; margin-bottom: 10pt">
The IMOL Members are the lifeforce of the IMOL community. The IMOL Members contribute to the development of the IMOL Community with these activities:

<ul style="margin-top: 10pt">
<li>Contribute to publicise the existence of the IMOL Community, and invite potentially interested people to apply for IMOL Membership</li>
<li>Propose activities such as the participation of the IMOL Community in conferences, the organisation of special issues on IMOL topics, the organisation of seminars</li>
<li>Participate in the IMOL Community’s activities and meetings at will</li>

Prior to joining the University of Massachusetts, Bruno was an associate professor at the Institute of Informatics at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS), in Brazil. Before that, he worked as a postdoctoral associate at the Aerospace Controls Laboratory at MIT (2015). Bruno received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Massachusetts (2014), under the supervision of Prof. Andrew Barto. Both his MSc. (2007) and B.S. cum laude (2004) degrees are in Computer Science from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, in Brazil. Bruno worked as a visiting researcher, on several occasions, at the Laboratory of Computational Neuroscience, in Rome, Italy, developing novel control algorithms for humanoid robots. He has also worked at Adobe Research, in California, developing large-scale machine learning techniques for digital marketing optimization. Bruno's research interests lie in the intersection of machine learning, reinforcement learning, optimal control theory, and robotics, and include the construction of hierarchical policies, active learning, Bayesian optimization applied to control, and machine learning algorithms with high-probability safety and fairness guarantees.

Cédric Colas is a postdoctoral researcher in the Computational Cognitive Science Lab at MIT. He holds a Master's degree in Cognitive Science from École Normale Supérieure in Paris and obtained a PhD in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Bordeaux under the supervision of Olivier Sigaud and Pierre-Yves Oudeyer. His PhD thesis introduced the concept of autotelic learning as a computational framework for endowing artificial agents with the ability to represent and pursue their own goals. Through the co-evolution of goal generation and goal achievement processes, autotelic learning makes the first steps towards a computational model of human’s ability to grow repertoires of skills throughout a lifetime. His current research interests include the examination of the role of linguistic interactions in shaping the goal representations of artificial agents.
